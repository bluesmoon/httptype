version 1.3.9cvs (devel)

15 March 2002
version 1.2.3 (stable)

- made 1.3.8 stable and renamed to 1.2.3


5 October 2001
version 1.3.8 (devel)

- User may specify hostfile, url and host:port on the command line
  all are considered.
- Program now uses Getopt to parse arguments
- Code cleanup and proper indentation added
- Fixed bugs in man page

6 April 2001
version 1.3.7 (devel)

- Added check for Servlet-Engine as well as Server - thanks to G. Vieri.
- Added option to pass a url instead of host and port - suggested by
  Dimi Shahbaz.
- Converted a lot of regex matches into simple string matches.
- Added /o switch to most regexes.

1 October 2000
version 1.3.6 (devel)

- Added a timeout value for hosts - suggested by Josef Radinger.

9 June 2000
version 1.3.5 (devel)

- Added a check to see whether the real hostname could be identified or
  not.  In some cases (dns problem?) this caused $realname to be undefined
  which caused a warning.
- Better tracing with --trace switch.
- Removed use of barewords as hash indexes.  This caused a warning on some
  implementations.  I don't know why it didn't in mine.

7 June 2000
version 1.3.4 (devel)

- Added --showreal option to display the real hostname.  This is useful
  if you use the canonical name or an alias.
- Added --showip option to display the IP address of the host.  If there
  are multiple IP addresses, only the first will be returned.

7 June 2000
version 1.2.2 (stable)

- Version 1.3.3 made stable to 1.2.2

8 April 2000
version 1.3.3 (devel)

- Added default login name option for proxy authentication - Binand.

25 March 2000
version 1.3.2 (devel)

- Added a fix for broken servers that do not respond to the HEAD method.
  Thanks to Ed Sawicki for pointing me to http://www.walgreens.com/

21 January 2000
version 1.3.1 (devel)

- Now prints a newline after accepting proxy authentication password from
  user. This was a problem only in cases where stdout and stderr prints to
  the same device.
- Default proxy port of 80 is used if none is specified. If you think this
  should be different, tell me what you think it should be and why.
- Starts polling hosts as soon as it has at least one host to poll. The
  earlier version would wait until the entire list of hosts was read from
  standard input or a file. This was a problem if the input was large, or
  generated on the fly.  The change reduces idle time.
- Can now read from multiple host files. If a hostfile and a command line
  host are both specified, the command line host is ignored.
- Increased modularity by moving a lot more code into subroutines.


13 January 2000
version 1.3.0 (devel)

- Added --debug and --trace switches for better error/bug detection
- Better error messages
- Added --serveronly switch to suppress display of information other than the
  server type
- Improved parsing of command line switches for improved error tolerance
- Added a manual page - finally
